# Cutleast Core Lib

A core library used by my projects. Because of being quite specialized to my own needs, I doubt that this is useful for others.

However, given that it is under the MIT license, you are free to use it as you see fit.

## Usage

```py
from cutleast_core_lib.core.utilities.scale import scale_value

print(scale_value(1253656678)) # '1.17 GB'
```
